# Results_Fetcher
Fetch Results from the univeristy's result server without manual intervention &amp; generate insights


This project was specifically built for my Universty's server.
Although, idea is the same if your Uni's results are not password protected.

# Background

Well, everybody want's to check their position in their class, also it's a big mess to go through each and every roll number manually.
I got lazy enough to automate the boring part and hence this project was born.
The reason I didn't build a UI to it is because it would be an overkill.
Hardly used once or twice a semseter, UI was totally unnecessary.
Apart from rankings, you can also calculate a few statistics namely, average gpa and number of students passed, failed & withheld.

# Usage
1. change the variable `purl` to the live results link.
2. change the `r_start` & `r_end` variables with starting and ending roll numbers.
3. Run the damn script.

# Note
Last used: July 2024 \n
Status: Working as intended

# Upcoming Features:
1. Relative GPA
